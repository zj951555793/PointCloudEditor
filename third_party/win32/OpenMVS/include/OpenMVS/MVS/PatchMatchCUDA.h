/**
 * @brief Propagate and refine the depth/normal estimate for a single pixel.
 *
 * This is the core PatchMatch iteration step, implementing the AMHMVS algorithm
 * (Asymmetric Multi-Hypothesis Multi-View Stereo). Each call processes one pixel
 * in a red-black checkerboard pattern, allowing parallel execution on GPU.
 *
 * The algorithm has four main phases:
 *
 * **Phase 1: Neighbor Hypothesis Gathering**
 * - Search 8 directional patterns (4 near + 4 far) to find best neighbor in each
 * - For each neighbor found, interpolate its plane to current pixel and compute
 *   per-view matching costs -> costArray[8][MAX_VIEWS]
 *
 * **Phase 2: Multi-Hypothesis Joint View Selection (AMHMVS)**
 * - Build view priors from 4-connected neighbors' selectedViews
 * - Compute sampling probability for each view based on:
 *   - Prior from neighbors (which views they found useful)
 *   - Cost performance across the 8 hypotheses (Gaussian-weighted)
 *   - Iteration-dependent threshold (stricter over time)
 * - Sample views via PDF->CDF to get viewWeights[]
 *
 * **Phase 3: Propagation**
 * - Aggregate each neighbor's costs using viewWeights
 * - Compare best neighbor against current estimate
 * - Adopt neighbor's plane if it gives lower cost
 *
 * **Phase 4: Refinement**
 * - Test 4 candidate planes to escape local minima:
 *   0. Perturbed depth + current normal
 *   1. Current depth + perturbed normal
 *   2. Current depth + random normal
 *   3. Current depth + surface normal (estimated from 4-connected neighbors)
 * - Adopt any candidate that improves the cost
 *
 * @see InitializePixelScore() for initial setup before iterations
 * @see ScorePlane() for the photometric matching cost computation
 * @see ProcessPixel() reads selectedViews from 4-connected neighbors processed in the
 *      previous kernel call (red reads black, black reads red). It writes selectedViews
 *      for the current pixel only when a better neighbor is adopted.
 *      The depth prior (lowDepths) does not directly influence propagation decisions.
 *      It only affects the cost computation inside ScorePlane() by blending NCC cost
 *      with depth-prior cost in textureless regions.
 * @see "Multi-View Stereo with Asymmetric Checkerboard Propagation and Multi-Hypothesis
 *       Joint View Selection" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07920)
